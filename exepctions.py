"""Write a short interactive Python program of your choice that uses try and except to catch and respond to at least two specific exceptions. Your program should:

Include a main() function.
Use try and except to catch specific errors like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
Provide helpful messages when errors occur.
Do something meaningful or funâ€”be creative! You could build a number guessing game, a basic calculator, or even a simple quiz with input validation.
